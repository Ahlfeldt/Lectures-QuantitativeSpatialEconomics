# Lecture sides on "Quantitative Spatial Economics"

## General remarks

These lecture slides are used in the course [Quantitative Spatial Economics](https://sites.google.com/view/bqse/bqse-teaching), which I teach to PhD students at the Berlin School of Economics and ambitious MSc students at Humboldt University. The course focuses on applied work, with an emphasis on coding, particularly in writing numerical solvers. A significant part of the learning experience occurs through [coursework](https://sites.google.com/view/bqse/bqse-teaching/2024-qse-course) that builds on replication directories and toolkits available on my GitHub page. The course is taught during the German summer term when I also co-organize the [Berlin School of Economics Quantitative Spaital Economics Research Seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/bqse/bqse-seminar) and is open to visiting PhD students.

**I hope you understand that due to time constraints, I cannot provide further explanations or feedback unless you are enrolled in the course**
